Certificate-Validation
======================

This is the OCSP/CRL Certificate Validation Feature I made for Apache Synapse. But this can be used by any other 
project at the Certificate Validation phase of SSL Handshake.

Please see the contribution to Apache Synapse in this JIRA location
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYNAPSE-954

Check the code in Synapse trunk
